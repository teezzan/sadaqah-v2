# Sadaqah

**Making peer sadaqah donations easy.**

If you've ever had to coordinate a group donation of any kind on a WhatsApp group, you'd know it's not the easiest thing to do. Having to remind everyone to pay on time and remember to send receipt for a small group could be tiring. Sadaqah is meant to solve that.

In a nutshell, Sadaqah provides the following.

- A transparent system of donation collection for a group of people.
- Ability to create multiple donations aimed at different goals. As a member, you simply choose which to donate to.
- One-off and recurring donations support for individuals with ability to revert any payment by an admin.
- An invitation based sign-up (Google) by current members of the group.
- Timely remittance of collected donations to administrator(s) of the group.
- Alerts for group members for all donations and remittances.

Once a group of people create a sadaqah group, we handle the heavy lifting of collection of donation and remittances as at when due.

**Note:**

***This is not a GoFundme-like platform. It's for people who know themselves and need a system to help ease sadaqah collection from themselves.***
